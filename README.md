# VIDEO MEMORABILITY PREDICTION BASED ON C3D FEATURES

MediaEval 2018 is a competition which took place at France, Sophia Antipolis and EURECOM in October 2018. This competition had various tasks and predicting media memorability is one among those. Memorability can be defined as how good or bad a person can remember any video after a specified period of time. This is a part of MediaEval 2018 Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation.This study proposes a prediction of short-term memorability and long term mermarbalitiy based on the video feature called C3D Feature.

# INTRODUCTION

The fast-growing digital video media makes our life more colorful. We may enjoy dozens or even hundreds of video clips everyday while watching TV, browsing the internet,
reading multimedia magazines, watching films, etc. However, the memorability of various videos is generally not equal. We can remember some videos for a long time while forgetting others quite soon. Two interesting questions naturally arising from this phenomenon are “What makes a video memorable?” and “Can we build computational models to predict the video memorability (VM)?” The study of these questions will significantly benefit a wealth of people including not only common users, but also professional ones such as artists, photographers, advertisers, and makers of video sharing websites, games, movies, and multimedia magazines.[8].In this work I investigate the video features to predict video memorability. We conducted an extensive analysis on these features and built different regression models to determine the most robust method amongst them for predicting memorability. Among the features provided for the model, I used HMP (Hierarchical Matching Pursuit) and C3D features in a deep learning model.
